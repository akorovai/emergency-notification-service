### Technical Specification (TS): Emergency Notification System

#### Overview
The Emergency Notification System is designed to send messages to users based on their contact information. Users can upload contacts from files, create message templates, and automatically send notifications to specified devices. The system should support multiple communication channels and ensure reliable delivery of notifications.

#### Functional Requirements

1. **User Contact Upload:**
   - Ability to upload users with contacts via CSV or .xls files.
   - Process data from files and store it in the database.

2. **Notification Template Creation and Configuration:**
   - Users can create and save message templates.
   - Configure sending parameters for each template (e.g., communication channels, priorities).

3. **Notification Sending:**
   - Send notifications to user-specified devices (e.g., SMS, email, push notifications).
   - Integration with various notification services, including Amazon SES, Twilio, ApplePush, OnAge, Vonage, Google SMTP, Telegram, WhatsApp.

#### Critical Requirements

1. **Scalability:**
   - The system must support sending notifications to up to one million users simultaneously.

2. **Failure Handling:**
   - The server may crash during notification sending.
   - All users must receive the message regardless of failures.

#### Architecture and Components

1. **Microservices:**
   - **Request Handling Service:** Receives notification requests and manages templates.
   - **Message Sending Service:** Handles sending notifications through various communication channels.

2. **Interfaces:**
   - **Kafka:** Used for message transmission between services and for managing sending queues.

3. **Notification Rebalancing:**
   - The system must include a notification rebalancing service to handle failed sending attempts.
   - Work with Kafka and the database to track unsent messages.

4. **Status System:**
   - Store information about message sending statuses in the database for monitoring and management.
